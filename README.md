- **Temperature**: 0.2 (ensures consistent, reliable results)
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds per request
- **Response Format**: Structured JSON with predefined fields
- **Cost**: Approximately $0.01-0.05 per candidate analysis

### AI Analysis Process
The system performs comprehensive analysis by:

1. **Text Extraction**: Parses PDF content from both job descriptions and resumes
2. **Data Preparation**: Structures the information for AI processing
3. **AI Analysis**: Sends data to OpenAI with carefully crafted prompts
4. **Response Processing**: Validates and stores the AI-generated insights

### Scoring Algorithm
The AI evaluates candidates based on:

- **Skills Match**: How well candidate skills align with job requirements
- **Experience Relevance**: Relevance and depth of work experience
- **Education Alignment**: Educational background vs. job requirements
- **Overall Fit**: Comprehensive assessment of candidate suitability

### AI Response Structure
Each analysis returns:

- **Strengths**: 3-6 specific bullet points highlighting candidate advantages
- **Weaknesses**: 3-6 areas where the candidate could improve
- **Score**: Numeric rating from 0-100 representing overall fit
- **Explanations**: Detailed reasoning behind the assessment

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Reliability

  - Server-side metering counters (per team/user): candidates created, resumes processed, AI tokens used
  - Feature gating by plan (batch size, export, custom prompts, SSO)
- Team/Org model: multiple seats, roles/permissions (Owner, Recruiter, Viewer)
- Background queues for AI analysis with progress notifications (email/in-app)
- Robust evaluation harness for LLM prompts and scoring consistency
- Prompt tuning and model fallbacks; caching of analysis to reduce costs
- Better PDF handling (OCR via Tesseract/Azure Vision for scanned PDFs)
- Analytics: pipeline funnel, time-to-score, accuracy feedback loop

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Setup Issues
- **Composer/Node errors**: Ensure PHP 8.2+ and Node.js 18+ are installed
- **Database connection**: Check `.env` file database configuration
- **Storage permissions**: Run `php artisan storage:link` and check file permissions

#### Runtime Issues
- **OpenAI API errors**: Verify API key and check quota/billing status
- **PDF parsing failures**: Ensure PDFs are text-based (not scanned images)
- **Route generation errors**: Run `php artisan wayfinder:generate` after adding new routes

#### Performance Issues
- **Slow analysis**: Normal for 10-30 seconds per candidate
- **Memory issues**: Consider increasing PHP memory limit for large PDFs
- **Database performance**: Consider upgrading from SQLite to MySQL/PostgreSQL

### Getting Help
1. **Check Application Logs**: Review `storage/logs/laravel.log` for detailed error information
